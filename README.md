# Dijkstra-Project-C
A Dijkstra's algorithm project written in C(Codeblocks IDE) using a stack. Nodes represented by UK Cities, edges are arbitrary for the sake of the algorithm.

The program functions by reading the edges between all nodes from the distances.txt file, the user can input which routes they want to by putting the start location and the destination in the citypairs.txt file like the examples already present in there.
The route taken for each journey and the total distance will then be outputted to the output.txt file.
